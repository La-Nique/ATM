# ATM

### Project 1 - ATM

###### Completed by Lanique Peterson

You are given the requirement of implementing 4 functions for an ATM class, you may choose to store/modify the state of the class however you see fit as long as the required functions work.

You are given two files: atm.h & atm.cpp

For this project I want you to implement the 4 functions: 

- [x] int getBalance()
- [x] int deposit(int amount)
- [x] int withdraw(int amount)
- [x] std::string getTransactionString()


You are free to add any private/public members/variables to the class as long as you fulfill the requirements for each function.
The expected output for each function can be found as a comment above each function declaration in the header file.
Notes: DO NOT rename the required 4 functions or change their declaration.

All atm class function implementations should happen in atm.cpp, I have provided function skeletons for the required functions.
Once again you are free to implement any helper functions in this file as long as they do not alter the required functions.
